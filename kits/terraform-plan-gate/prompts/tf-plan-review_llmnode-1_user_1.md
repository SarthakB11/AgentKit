Write the review comment in this shape:
1. One line verdict sentence: what we recommend (apply as-is, apply after the listed fixes, or do not apply) and why, in plain words.
2. "### Findings" - one bullet per change that is medium or above, ordered critical first: `address` - risk - what is wrong - policy ids in square brackets only when there are any - the fix. If there are more than 12 such changes, write full bullets for the 12 highest and then a compact line per remaining change: `address` - risk - policy ids. Every medium-or-above address must appear.
3. "### Before apply" - a checklist of concrete steps (backup/snapshot names, change window, owner sign-off, split plan) derived from the mitigations. Omit this section if there is nothing above low.
4. "### Routine" - one line listing the low-risk addresses, or "none". More than 20: list the first 20 and end with "and N more".
Aim for under 300 words for a plan with up to 12 findings; the compact lines above are the only allowed overflow.
